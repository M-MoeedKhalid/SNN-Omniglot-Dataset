# Siamese-Neural-Networks-omniglot-dataset

This code was written to test the behavior of contrastive loss(with Eucledian distance) against cross entropy loss(with Eucledian and Cosine Distance) using Siamese Neural networks on the omniglot dataset.
The research done for this can be found attached to this repository.
